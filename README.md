# Tauri Experiments

Seeing how to use [Tauri](https://tauri.dev), with an eye for using it in game dev

Focusing on using vanilla JS with tauri. The tauri cli tool is installed with `cargo install tauri-cli`

Running a project: nav to the project folder and run `cargo tauri dev`

Update tauri cli with `cargo install tauri-cli` (update rust if required with `rustup update`)
